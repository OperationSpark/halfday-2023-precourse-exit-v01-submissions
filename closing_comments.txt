
1. Did you experience extenuating circumstances when taking the assessment?
   > [ex. Computer froze and it took 15 minutes to fix]
TODO: Describe any issues that occurred, what happened, time to fix the problem.


I was running out of power in my laptop (I used a charger at the last minute), I had to "hold it in" for the duration of the test before I could use the bathroom (self-explanatory), I had trouble with rounding down (Greg helped me), and I had trouble editing objects (i figured that out on my own through trial and error).

Nothing too serious in my opinion.

2. Were you able to complete the assessment in total, all tests passing?


Yes

3. Do you have additional comments regarding the administration and/or content of the assessment?

No
