
1. Did you experience extenuating circumstances when taking the assessment?
   > [ex. Computer froze and it took 15 minutes to fix]
TODO: Describe any issues that occurred, what happened, time to fix the problem.


No, I did not.




2. Were you able to complete the assessment in total, all tests passing?

I was able to go over all of the problems. I made psuedocode and I understood everything i needed to do. The problem is implementing it.
I had a lot of issues trying to do stuff and honestly was just stuck on a lot of it.


3. Do you have additional comments regarding the administration and/or content of the assessment?

No, the administration was good and suprisingly the challange was kind of fun, i was just left frustrated
